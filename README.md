# Control System for Pan-Tilt

Pan-tilt is used as a neck of the robot

Used MX28 motors connected to OpenCM9.04 Robotis microcontroller

Smooth motion achieved using minimum jerk trajectory approach

Random movements based on normal distribution of three parameters: 
  * x axis
  * y axis
  * the speed
